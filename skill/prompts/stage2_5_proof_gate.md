# Stage 2.5: Proof Gate

**Role**: Quality Assurance.
**Goal**: Check the rendered output against the original blueprint.

## Checklist

1.  **Text Match**: Does the rendered text match the `(LOCKED)` blocks in the blueprint character-for-character?
2.  **Spelling**: Are there any spelling errors in the blueprint that need correcting *before* final rendering?
3.  **Visual Logic**: Do the image prompts accurately reflect the visual anchors described?
4.  **Motif Adherence**: Do the image prompts contain the necessary keywords for the chosen motif?

If any checks fail, return to the appropriate stage (Stage 1 for text issues, Stage 2 for prompt issues) and revise.
