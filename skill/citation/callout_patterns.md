# Citation Callout Patterns

When generating the Blueprint body text, use these patterns to handle citations gracefully within the 40-word limit.

## Pattern A: The Indirect Nudge
> "As Deutsch argues [S1], reality is not single-threaded."

## Pattern B: The Fact Anchor
> "Computing power doubles every 18 months [S2]."

## Pattern C: The Visual Link
> "Like the library of Babel [S3], our options are infinite."

**Note**: The Renderer will likely strip the `[S#]` markers from the *Image Prompt*, but they must remain in the `BODY TEXT (LOCKED)` so they appear in the final image overlay (or caption, depending on user preference).
